# Find-the-Poet-of-a-Poem

## Introduction

In this project, we intend to design a program that, by receiving a poem, guesses the name of the poet who composed it.

A collection of poems related to three famous Iranian poets (Ferdowsi, Hafez ,and Rumi) exists. This set is divided into two sets of educational data and experimental.

In the educational set of three files, there is a .txt that contains the poems of each of the mentioned poets (the format of these files is such that in each line, a stanza of the desired poet is given). 

Now, we use a training set to generate a language model for each of these poets and then identify based on these models that each poem belongs to which poet.

## Language
